# 4-BIT-Arithmetic-And-Logic-Unit
As it is the most important component of C.P.U which is capable of performing all arithmetic and logical operations which inspired and motivated to design this on software as well as hardware level.

Main modules :

1) Addition

2) Subtraction

3)Multiplication

4)Division

5)Comparators (Less,greater and equal indicator)

All above circuits are designed on logicworks
